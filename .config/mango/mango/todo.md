# List of things to do to completely configure mangowc

- [ ] Run through list of available layouts and test them
      Layouts tested so far:
- [x] Tile
- [-] scroller
- [-] monocle
- [-] grid
- [-] deck
- [-] center_tile
- [-] right_tile
- [-] vertical_tile
- [-] vertical_scroller
- [-] vertical_grid
- [-] vertical_spiral
- [-] vertical_deck

  Also consider the tagrules to test as well along with the waybar config

- [-] Figure out how the monitor tag works. Apparently you can just switch to a different monitor via focusmon command

- [-] Figure out how the windowrules for opacity work
